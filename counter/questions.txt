what is a div ??
why do we use divs ??

i found a great explanation for this in reddit
Consider a box of chocolates, the box is div, chocolates are elements.
Now keeping 1 chocolate outside is fine, if you want to move it up down or wherever you can,
but if you have two chocolates outside then you have to move each individually even if its in
the same direction. But if you put them in a box (div) then you just have to move the box around.
Now for section, imagine having all the ferrero rochers in one big box (section) and then black rochers
can go in black rocher div in the big box, white can go in white rochers div and so on. Then you have all
the nutty chocolates in a big box (section) where almond chocolates can go in almond div in big box and so on.

what is a margin and what is the width?
what is a flex_box ?
what is the innertext ?
